### Types of Errors in JavaScript

JavaScript errors can be categorized into several types based on their nature and when they occur:

1. **Syntax Errors**:

   - Occur during code parsing.
   - Caused by incorrect syntax, such as missing parentheses, semicolons, or curly braces.
   - Prevents code execution.

2. **Reference Errors**:

   - Occur when trying to access an undeclared variable or object.
   - Also happens when accessing properties on `null` or `undefined` values.
   - Prevents code execution.

3. **Type Errors**:

   - Occur when an operation is performed on an inappropriate data type.
   - For example, trying to call a non-existent function or perform arithmetic on a string.
   - Prevents code execution.

4. **Range Errors**:

   - Occur when an illegal or invalid index is used for an array or string.
   - For example, accessing an array element with an out-of-range index.
   - Prevents code execution.

5. **Internal Errors**:

   - Occur due to JavaScript engine issues.
   - Rarely encountered, and usually, there's little you can do as a developer.
   - Examples include exceeding call stack size (Stack Overflow) or running out of memory.

6. **Custom Errors**:
   - Developers can create custom error objects using the `Error` constructor or extending built-in errors.
   - Useful for handling specific application logic.
   - Not built-in, so you define their behavior.

Handling errors in JavaScript often involves using try-catch blocks or utilizing error handling functions like `onerror` for asynchronous code. Proper error handling can help improve the reliability and robustness of your JavaScript applications.
